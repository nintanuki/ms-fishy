# Change Log

This file is an append-only record of every code change made to **<RENAME ME — your project name>**
by a human, AI assistant, or copilot tool. Read it before making changes so you know the current state of the codebase.

> **First step when you copy this template:** replace `<RENAME ME — your project name>` above with the real project name.

## Format

Each entry covers one logical change (which may touch multiple files). Use the
template below, with one `**File:** ... **Why:** ...` block per file touched.

    ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — short summary

    **File:** path/to/file.py
    **Lines (at time of edit):** 38-52 (modified)
    **Before:**
        [old code]
    **After:**
        [new code]
    **Why:** explanation

## Conventions

* Line numbers reflect the file as it existed at the moment of the edit. Edits
  above shift line numbers below, so older entries will not match the current
  file. Never go back and "fix" old line numbers.
* Entries are append-only. Never delete history. If a later edit reverts an
  earlier one, write a new entry that references the original.
* For new files, write `(new file)` instead of a line range. The "Before"
  block can be omitted or marked `(file did not exist)`.
* For deletes, write `(deleted)` and put the removed code in "Before" with no
  "After" block.
* Keep "Before" / "After" blocks short. If a change is huge, summarize with a
  diff-style excerpt of the most important lines plus a sentence describing the
  rest, instead of pasting the entire file.
* New Entries should be BELOW this line, do not add new log entries to the top. These instructions must stay on top.

## 2026-05-07 — Generic-template cleanup pass

**File:** main.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 12-31 (modified)
**Before:** `__init__` docstring referenced "the first dungeon level"; kept an unused `self.game_active = False`; called `set_mode((ScreenSettings.RESOLUTION), pygame.SCALED)` with redundant parens.
**After:** Generic docstring, no `game_active`, `set_mode(ScreenSettings.RESOLUTION, pygame.SCALED)`.
**Why:** Template was copy-pasted from a dungeon project; needed to be neutral so it can seed any new pygame project.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** main.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 45-51 (modified)
**Before:** `reset_game` docstring was a 7-line block.
**After:** Tightened to a 4-line block with the same intent.
**Why:** Cosmetic; matches the docstring style of the rest of the file.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** main.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 80-87 (modified)
**Before:** `_handle_keydown` only handled `F11`.
**After:** Added an `Esc` quit branch above the `F11` branch.
**Why:** So the template runs without a controller for development.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** settings.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 22 (modified)
**Before:** `TITLE = "Mimic Dice"`
**After:** `TITLE = "Pygame Template"  # Replace with your project's name.`
**Why:** Generic placeholder for the template.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** settings.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 58-66 (modified)
**Before:** `AssetPaths.TV = "assets/graphics/effects/tv.png"`; `DebugSettings.MUTE = False` duplicated `AudioSettings.MUTE`.
**After:** `AssetPaths.TV` is now `__file__`-relative via `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ...)`; the duplicate `DebugSettings.MUTE` was removed.
**Why:** Cwd-relative paths break when launched via the arcade cabinet; duplicate mute flags caused ambiguity.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** crt.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** 1-3 (modified)
**Before:** `from settings import *`
**After:** `from settings import ScreenSettings, ColorSettings, AssetPaths`
**Why:** Explicit imports match `main.py` and make dependencies obvious.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** core/__init__.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** (new file)
**After:** `"""Core data classes and state machines for the game."""`
**Why:** Empty folders weren't tracked by git; gives the package a docstring and a stable home.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** systems/__init__.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** (new file)
**After:** `"""Gameplay systems (physics, AI, scoring, etc.)."""`
**Why:** Same as `core/__init__.py`.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** ui/__init__.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** (new file)
**After:** `"""User-interface widgets, screens, and HUD elements."""`
**Why:** Same as `core/__init__.py`.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** utils/__init__.py
**Lines (at time of edit):** (new file)
**After:** `"""Pure helper functions and small utilities."""`
**Why:** Same as `core/__init__.py`.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)

**File:** README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/TESTING.md, docs/TODO.md
**Why:** Reflected the code changes above (Esc now wired, `__init__.py` files exist) and added a "first-run setup, delete this block afterwards" section to README + a delete-this-section instruction on the first-run checklist in docs/TODO.md.
**Editor:** Bryan (Claude Opus 4.7)
